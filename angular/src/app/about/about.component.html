    <h1> API Overview </h1>
    <p>
        API is the acronym for <span class='bold'>Application Programming Interface,</span>  which is a remote server that our Javascript code can communicate with to usually pull in data from the database. Once the browser sends a request to the server, unless the internet is not functional, the response will always come back from the server. An API allows a user to sort through data in the most efficient way possible, as well as updating, adding, and deleting data, this makes it simple to pull only the information that we requested onto the webpage.

    <h2>How APIs are used Everyday</h2>
        <p> APIs play a huge role in our everyday life since they allow us to easily share important data. API functions like a middleman (a virtual one, of course) as it relays information from one interface, like a website or mobile app. </p>

            <li> Paying with PayPal </li>

            <li> Streaming services (like Netflix and spotify (allowing user to search through different tpyes of music and movies )) </li>

    <h2> Identifying Good APIs </h2>
    <p>
        APIs are the first way developers access and interact with your products. A good API will enhance the user's experience, providing complete, accurate, and easy to read documentation. Another good quality of an API is great error handling, it is important that an application provides the specific error code and human readable message in order to provide as much help to the developer so they can fix the issue. Lastly, a great API is one that can be equally gentle with students in this program while empowering experienced users. Check out the API database on the homepage to find a great API for your next project!

    <h2> Types of APIâ€™s </h2>
    <p>
        There are four basic types of APIs:
    </p>
         <ul> <!--Add updated definition from doc -->
            <li><span class='bold'>Private APIs</span> are published internally for use by developers to improve its products and services. Private APIs are not exposed to third parties. </li>
            <li><span class='bold'>Public APIs</span> are published publicly and can be used by any third party. There are no restrictions on these APIs.</li>
            <li><span class='bold'>Partner APIs</span> can only be used by specific parties with whom the owner agrees to share data. Partner APIs are used within business relationships, often to integrate software between partnering companies. </li>
            <li><span class='bold'>Composite APIs</span> combine multiple APIs to address related or interdependent tasks, and often improve speed and performance compared with individual APIs.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2> The make up of an API </h2>
     <p> So far we have learned that an API is how interfaces communicate with eachother, but how does that communication take place? </p>
     <p>APIs consist of three parts: </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> User: the person executing the request </li> 
            <li> Client: the interface that sends the request to the server </li> 
            <li> Server: the interface that responds to the request </li> 
        </ul>

    <h2> Actions You Can Take Through an API </h2>
        <p> Similar to this web application created, a server will be built first to hold the data. Once the server is running a developer can use the endpoints created by the programmer to filter or search the data on the server, or build thier own program that rus searches on the data base. If you havent realized it yet, you can build amazing things with APIs. However, before you jump right into to using APIs, it would be great to know the 4 types of actions an API can take: </p>
        <ul> 
            <li>GET: requests data from a server. This request can result in displaying all the data or specific to one single type of information depending on what the user would like to "GET" from the server. </li>
            <li>POST: sends changes from the client to the server. This request is used to add new information to the server. </li>
            <li>PUT: updates existing information. This request is used to revise or change any existing data on the server. </li>
            <li>DELETE: deltes existing information. This request results in existing information on the server being deleted. </li>
        </ul>
